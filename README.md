# Trivia
This is a [trivia app](https://chrismenke45.github.io/trivia) I am building to practice Tailwind CSS

## How its made:
Tech used: Vanilla TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and webpack
<br/>
This app uses an external api to fetch trivia questions for the user. Vanilla typescript is used to display these questions for the user and Tailwind CSS was used to style the app. Webpack was used as a module bundler and I made a custom [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/chrismenke45/trivia/blob/main/webpack.config.js) for all the app's needs.
## Optimizations
This app has a lot of room to grow. Currently, the user(s) can select question difficulty and category and then play, but no data is stored about the user. I could set up either an api or use localstorage to persist user data in between sessions. I could also create a more elegant UI.
## Lessons Learned
This app was all about learning Tailwind CSS. It was a great introduction to a tool I know I will continue to use in the future.
